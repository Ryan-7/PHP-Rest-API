# PHP-Rest-API
Todo app with a framework-less PHP Rest API on backend.

# Setup
Currently the API will only read from the database and output on the client. 
Create a local DB and add a few items for title, body and id. 
Make sure to set `connectedToDb` to true.

Or

The client will render with mock data if no db in use.

# Up next
