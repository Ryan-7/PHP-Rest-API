# PHP-Rest-API
A simple Single Page Application using framework-less JavaScript client and framework-less PHP API.

Uses the `fetch()` API to hit the backend and `ES6` for rendering the view and `Bootstrap` CSS framework.

# Setup
Currently the API will read and delete items from the client side. 
Create a local DB `todo` and add a few `items` for title, body and id. 
Make sure to set `connectedToDb` to `true`.

Or

Keep `connectedToDb` set to `false`.
The client will render with mock data if no db in use.

# Up next
API:  Add item, error handling

Client: add item method, error handling
